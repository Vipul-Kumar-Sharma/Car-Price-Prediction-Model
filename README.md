Car price prediction project is an implementation of Machine Learning algorithm. This project is                
implemented using Python Language.Determining whether the listed price of a used car is a challenging task, due to the many factors that 
drive a used vehicleâ€™s price on the market. The focus of this project is developing machine learning 
models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make 
informed purchases. This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model 
name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven. It then predict the 
price of the car. 
 
The Project was given a form of Website where we use Linear Regression Model to perform the 
predictions.
